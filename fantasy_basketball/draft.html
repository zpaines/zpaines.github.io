  <h3>Fantasy Basketball Production for the top 200 NBA Players</h3>
  <p> Auction Values are from Yahoo sports
    for the 2020-2021 Season.
    Production is a similar stat to "z-score", it measures how far above the average player
    is that player in each category (total production is simply the sum of production for all categories).</p>
