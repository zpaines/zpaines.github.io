    <h3>Fantasy Basketball Visualizations</h3>
    <p>
        This is the table of contents for my fantasy basketball visualization series.
        All visualizations are based on the ESPN standard 9 categories.
        Data is from Basketball Reference and Yahoo. Stats are current up to 1/16/2021.
        Currently it's a manual process to update them, but I'll try to do so occasionally!
