    <h3>Fantasy Basketball Stat Correlations</h3>
    <h5><i>(Best Viewed on a Computer)</i></h5>
    <p>
        This is Part 2 of my <a href='/fantasy_basketball'>series on Fantasy Basketball</a>.
        These posts will specifically focus on 9 category fantasy with
        <i>Field Goal %, Free Throw %, Three Pointers Made, Points, Blocks, Steals, Turnovers, Assists, Rebounds</i>. 
        They will also be focused on auction leagues with a $200 bidding budget.
    </p>
    <p>
        The table below shows the Pearson correlation coefficients for all the 9 categories, as well as
        my own derived free throw and field goal % values (<code>makes * (player % - league average %)</code>) that take volume into account.
        Click on a cell in the table to view a chart of players' stats in the respective categories.

        Essentially the higher the number, the more the two stats tend to move together. A 0 would indicate they have no relationship, and a negative number indicates they tend to move in opposite directions. Note that turnovers are negated for the correlation since fewer turnovers is a better result.
