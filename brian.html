<h2>A Eulogy and Thoughts on Risk</h2>
<p><i>“The Edge... There is no honest way to explain it because the only people who really know where it is are the ones who have gone over</i></p>

<p>My texts with Brian are full of canceled plans and half baked trip ideas. We sent each other pictures from climbs and skis, and he added me to his group chat dedicated to trail running in the North Bend area. His last text to me was “Prolly going to rock climb this weekend if you’re down”. He fell off a ledge in the North Cascades and died a month later. In the end we only ever did one real trip together, a climb of the Emmons glacier to the summit of Mt. Rainier. We froze our asses off in extreme wind and huddled together on the volcano rim, staring through goggles at the Puget Sound in the distance.
</p>

<p>Brian was busy, and flaky, and frustrating to plan with. He was always juggling work and family with an insatiable desire to get out. He would often cancel last minute. But he was careful and thorough in the mountains. He had strong rope skills and we talked a lot about decision making. I would never have described him as a risk taker.

<p>And yet, whether he realized it or not, he was taking massive risks. As am I.
</p>

<p>It’s dangerous out there. When you start pushing the difficulty of trips, the margin between being safe and being fucked can become very thin. In the image below, Brent and I brought a rope that was a couple meters too short, leaving us to downclimb some icy rocks in our ski boots. In retrospect, maybe we should have bailed on the route and just climbed back up on the rope. But we didn’t and we were fine.

<p>The close calls accumulate. But the thing about dying is that close calls is all you get. You only learn once where the line is between a close call and the final call.
</p>

<p>I don’t know how to think about this. You can do the math and realize that any trip that isn’t 99% safe isn’t worth it if you want to do a full lifetime of trips. But what does it mean to be 99% safe? I don’t know how the snow will behave on one ridge compared to the other. A river might suck you to the bottom one day or spit you out the next. One centimeter might be the difference between stepping on a crevasse or plunging through.
</p>

<p>I’ll only know whether it was worth it or not in retrospect. I feel most alive in the outdoors, solving problems with my mind and body working in sync. The feeling of powerlessness is what draws me - it’s about navigating an environment that is beautiful and harsh rather than constructing one to suit yourself. It’s about feeling scared, and focusing completely on each step because you know there is no room for error. And if you make it home, then you get to drink the best coffee you’ve ever had. And nobody knows how it feels if you don’t.
