<h1>December 24th Polar Brunch</h1>
<p>To kick off the holiday weekend, you're invited to jump in Lake Washington and then reconvene at my house for hot drinks and some food!</p>

<p> Feel free to come even if you don't want to jump in the lake - but trust me that it will be fun! You can also shower at my house post lake - but bring a towel.</p>
