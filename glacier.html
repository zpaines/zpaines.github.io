<p> I'll let the video do most of the talking, but Sarah and I skiied Glacier peak over Memorial Day weekend and it was great.</p>
<p> We had originally planned on making the trip over two nights. However due to the theft of Sarah's shoes (shown at the end of the video) and subsequent discovery, we headed out on the second day after summitting. Overall it was a roughly 36 hour trip, we started hiking around 9am on Saturday and wrapped up at 9pm on Sunday.</p>
