<h1>About The Site</h1>
<p>This site is generated with Jekyll.
It's hosted on <a href=https://github.com/zpaines/zpaines.github.io>Github</a>.
It has no external dependencies and currently 0 javascript! In my opinion, this is a good thing. 
It renders well on every device, it's fast, and it's accessible to users with screen readers and other alternative ways of browsing the content.</p>

    I decided to make this site for a few reasons. For one it seemed like an good way to reach out to potential employers and hopefully boost my career.
    I also would like to host my blog here at some point instead of Medium, since I can create more complex and unique pages (particularly useful for 
    technical project write ups).
    I think the web is best when people host their own content and can be a little more zany!
    It also seemed like a good way to learn about tech that I don't use at work, like static site generators.
