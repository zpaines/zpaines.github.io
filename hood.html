<h1> Skiing Hood without getting in a car </h1>
<p> I have a long running goal of skiing all the (big) volcanoes on the west coast of the US. However, as I start to attempt ones that are farther from Seattle, I don't want to drive so far just to ski one objective.
  Especially for something like Hood, which is a relatively easy objective. So I decided to try and ski it without using a car at all. 
  Jake and I biked from our houses in Seattle to the Amtrak station, took the train to Portland, biked from Portland to Mt. Hood, skiied Mt. Hood, and biked back to the Amtrak in Portland.
  We didn't summit because of weather at the top of Hood, but overall it was an excellent and quite challenging trip.
