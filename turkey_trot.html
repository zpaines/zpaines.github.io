<h1>Turkey Trot / Dip / Picnic</h1>
<p> Since we're having a limited Thanksgiving this year, I thought it would be nice to have an outdoor hangout. We're going to do a 5k run (you can race if you want), followed by a jump in the lake, and then a picnic Friendsgiving (BYOF although I'll try and bring hot chocolate and coffee). You're welcome to join for any of these activities!</p>

<p> We might even have a prize for first and last place! </p>

<h2> Details </h2>
