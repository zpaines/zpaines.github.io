<h1>Turkey Trop / Dip / Picnic</h1>
<p> Since we're all having a limited Thanksgiving this year, we're doing an outdoor hangout. We're going to do a 5k race, then a jump in the lake, and then a picnic (BYOF although I'll try and bring hot chocolate and coffee). You're welcome to join for any of these activities!</p>

<h2> Details </h2>
<p> Please join us at Magnuson Park at 1pm on Friday, November 27th </p>
