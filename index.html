<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>This is Zach's site</h2>
<h4>Zach Sabin, that is</h4>
<p> Currently I'm working on a <a href='/fantasy_basketball'>series of visualizations about fantasy basketball</a></p>
<p>I am also starting to put up outdoor trip reports:
    <ul>
        <li><a href='/eldorado'>Skiing Eldorado C2C</a></li>
        <li><a href='/glacier'>Skiing Glacier Peak</a></li>
        <li><a href='/rainier'>Hiking Rainier</a></li>
        <li>Climbing Mt. Stuart (coming soon)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
<br>
<p> 
    I moved away from the blog format a bit when I started building out this website as I wanted to try making more visualizations (which take a lot longer than just writing) and videos (same issue!) and as a result don't have a  
    table of contents for my blog posts here. But here are a my current two favorite blog-style posts that I've written over the last few years:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@zacharysabin/how-to-win-credit-card-roulette-759ffb64a9b6">How to win at credit card roulette.</a></p>
            <p>This one is just fun, and nicely illustrates how the EV of a game is far from a complete description of the outcomes you should expect. It's also the blog post that generated the most conversation among my friends.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@zacharysabin/should-you-roll-1-or-2-dice-in-risk-defense-e36bd7df24c5">Should you roll one or two dice in Risk?</a></p>
            <p>My first ever blog post, I wrote this to settle a discussion I had while playing Risk. This one is nice because it continues to get 100-200 hits a week, all from Google searches (I think it is the top result for a few "how many dice ... in risk" searches). It also spiked during the initial COVID lockdowns to 1000 reads a week which was kind of neat to witness.</p>
        </li>

    </ul>
