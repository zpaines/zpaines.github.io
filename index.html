<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>This is Zach's site</h2>
<h4>Zach Sabin, that is</h4>
<p> At work I enjoy taking cutting edge technology and bringing it into the real world. In the past I've worked on applying NLP (such as early versions of Transformers) and applying it to legal documents and customer support. Currently I work as the flight software lead at Starfish Space. Outside of work I like extreme outdoors trips, math, reading, and reminscing on my ultimate frisbee career.</p>
<p> You can reach me at my last name (Sabin) appended to my first name (Zachary) at gmail</p>

<p> 
    I moved away from the blog format a bit when I started building out this website as I wanted to try making more visualizations (which take a lot longer than just writing) and videos (same issue!) and as a result don't have a  
    table of contents for my blog posts here. But here are a my current two favorite blog-style posts that I've written over the last few years:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@zacharysabin/how-to-win-credit-card-roulette-759ffb64a9b6">How to win at credit card roulette.</a></p>
            <p>This one is just fun, and nicely illustrates how the EV of a game is far from a complete description of the outcomes you should expect. It's also the blog post that generated the most conversation among my friends.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p><a href="https://medium.com/@zacharysabin/should-you-roll-1-or-2-dice-in-risk-defense-e36bd7df24c5">Should you roll one or two dice in Risk?</a></p>
            <p>My first ever blog post, I wrote this to settle a discussion I had while playing Risk. This one is nice because it continues to get 100-200 hits a week, all from Google searches (I think it is the top result for a few "how many dice ... in risk" searches). It also spiked during the initial COVID lockdowns to 1000 reads a week which was kind of neat to witness.</p>

    </ul>
