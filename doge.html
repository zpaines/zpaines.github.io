<h1>Dogecoin is crypto’s mask off moment.</h1>

<p>Let me preface this post by saying that I have owned a variety of crypto currencies throughout the years. I am the rare person who has actually purchased tangible goods using crypto currencies, rather than just using them as a tool for speculation. However, crypto currencies have now strayed far from their roots and have become divorced from any sense of usefulness or innovation. Even in 2017 (the last peak of the crypto bubble), I remember that there was at least an undercurrent of real world applications with articles being written about Bitcoin debit cards and Ethereum smart contracts. The focus now is exclusively on market cap and token value, both of which are easily manipulated and fundamentally meaningless when it comes to actual real world use cases or innovation.</p>

<p>Enter dogecoin. Dogecoin started as a joke, intended to make fun of the entire crypto space. It was built incredibly quickly by forking the Bitcoin code and was essentially an internet art project. And now its value has rocketed up.</p>

<p>Even as the number has gone up, there is still no pretense of usefulness or innovation. There are no inspirational quotes about how dogecoin will free you from the tyranny of fiat currency or solve the world’s economic problems. No, the value proposition of dogecoin is simply that someone else will buy it from you for more money later on. Which at this point, is how all crypto currencies are viewed. So thank you Dogecoin, for at least being honest.</p>
