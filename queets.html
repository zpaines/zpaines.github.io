<h1> Following the Queets from Glacier to Ocean </h1>
<p>In May of 2023 Brad, Telise, and myself hiked to the base of the Queets glacier and then bushwacked / rafted down the river valley to the Pacific. 
  As far as we can tell, fewer than 10 other people have ever done this trip, and the land was incredibly rugged. The bushwacking was brutally difficult 
  and far more dangerous than we had anticipated. The rafting was relatively chill and enjoyable. We saw Service falls from the ground, which <a href="https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/remote-doesn-t-begin-to-describe-service-falls-1276811.php"> only a few other people</a> 
  have ever done.
